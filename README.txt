Copyright (c) Vladimir Dzhuvinov, 2009 - 2015


README

Java classes to represent, parse and serialise JSON-RPC 2.0 requests, 
notifications and responses.


Requirements:

    * Java 1.5 or later

    * The package depends on the JSON Smart library for JSON encoding and
      decoding (fork of the popular JSON.simple toolkit, but with more
      efficient parsing).


Visit the library home page for usage, examples and updates:
